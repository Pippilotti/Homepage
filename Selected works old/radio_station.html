<h2>Radio Station</h2>

<div id="Spalte_1">
<p>2017 <br> web-radio <br> 24/7 <br><br>
The radio station is broadcasting the noises of the gallery 24/7 during the exhibition time. Visitors of the gallery automatically participate: their foodsteps or voices are quietly recorded and broadcasted. They also have the chance to actively make use of the radio station and have a talk into the microphone. Planned contributions (talks, readings or audio pieces) of and with befriended artists are broadcasted every day at 3pm. All the broadcasts have a blurred start and a blurred ending, since all the noises of the room are recorded subtly in the background.
Everybody can listen to the radio station from everywhere via the internet.
