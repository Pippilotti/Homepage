‹A furry agora› is a social room on a natural plateau in the wilderness of the mountains of Northern Greece. During one week the elements have been installed there to gather all entities of the area in a social assembly - functioning as a residency for all entities. Consisting of specific elements, the furry agora helps the entities to live comfortably, to communicate and to reflect as a furry parliament.
